### üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

| Feature        | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using both statistical and visual methods. |
| **Purpose**    | To understand the structure, spot anomalies, test assumptions, and find patterns or relationships in the data.              |
| **Includes**   | Summary statistics, handling missing values, checking distributions, correlations, outliers, and data types.                |
| **Techniques** | Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std), groupings, hypothesis testing, correlation matrices, boxplots, histograms, etc. |
| **Outcome**    | A deeper understanding of the data that helps shape further analysis or model building.                                     |

### üìä **Data Visualization**

| Feature        | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. |
| **Purpose**    | To communicate findings, trends, and insights in an understandable and engaging way.                                            |
| **Includes**   | Plotting charts such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, pie charts, etc.                                       |
| **Techniques** | Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI, Tableau, etc.                                                       |
| **Outcome**    | Clear, insightful visuals that help in decision-making and storytelling.                                                        |

| **EDA**                | Imagine you're preparing to cook a new dish. You start by checking all the ingredients ‚Äî how fresh they are, how much you have, and what combinations might work. Maybe you even taste a bit, or try mixing small amounts to test the flavor. **This is like EDA** ‚Äî you're exploring and understanding your ingredients (data) before fully using them. |
| **Data Visualization** | Once your dish is ready, you serve it on a plate ‚Äî nicely arranged, colorful, and appealing. This presentation makes it easy for someone else to understand what's in the dish and enjoy it. **This is like Data Visualization** ‚Äî you present the findings in a way that's clear and attractive to others.                                              |
