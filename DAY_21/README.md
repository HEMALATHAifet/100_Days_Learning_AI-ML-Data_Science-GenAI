## ðŸ“„ Plagiarism Checker (Basic) â€“ NLTK Based

This is a simple plagiarism checker written in Python that compares two input texts using **Jaccard Similarity** on **n-grams** after removing stopwords and punctuation.

### âœ¨ Features

* Uses **NLTK** for:

  * Tokenization
  * Stopword removal
  * n-gram generation
  * Jaccard distance
* Preprocessing includes:

  * Lowercasing
  * Punctuation removal
  * Stopword removal
* Detects high textual overlap between two documents or strings.

### ðŸ”§ Requirements

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Download NLTK data resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### ðŸ“š How it Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, punctuation and stopword removal.
2. **n-gram Generation**: Default `n=3`.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Jaccard similarity = `1 - jaccard_distance`.
4. **Plagiarism Check**: If similarity â‰¥ threshold (default 0.5), it's flagged.

### ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

* Compare uploaded files (PDF, DOCX)
* Check against web sources (with Copyleaks or Turnitin API)
* Add Gradio interface
* Use TF-IDF or BERT embeddings for advanced comparison
