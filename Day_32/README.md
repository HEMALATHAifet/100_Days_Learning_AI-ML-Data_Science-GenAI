### ✅ Day 32/100 – Communicate Insights (DA) vs Split the Data (DS)

📍 In today’s #100DaysOfLearning post, I focused on the final steps before modeling in both **Data Analysis** and **Data Science**, using the **Maternal Health and High-Risk Pregnancy Dataset**.

### 🧪 Data Analysis Step 6: Communicate Insights

📊 After deeply exploring the data, I focused on turning findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.

💡 **Key Insights:**

* Over **80% of high-risk pregnancies** involved either high BP or diabetes
* **BMI > 35** was consistently associated with elevated risk
* **Mental Health scores** varied widely across all groups, making them less reliable for prediction

📌 **Visualizations Used:**

* Heatmaps to highlight feature correlations
* Pie charts to show risk level distribution
* Boxplots for comparing numeric variables across risk groups

🎯 **Objective**: Present insights in a way that helps healthcare professionals prioritize early intervention and support.

### 🤖 Data Science Step 6: Split the Data

Before modeling, I split the dataset into training and testing sets.

✅ **Why this is important:**

* Ensures **fair evaluation** of the model
* **Stratification** maintains class balance across train and test sets
* Keeps the test data unseen to prevent overfitting

📊 Class distribution remained consistent across splits, preserving the dataset’s integrity.

### 🔍 Key Difference:

* **DA** is about *explaining* what happened and why
* **DS** is about *preparing* for prediction

📅 Coming up on **Day 33**:

* 🤖 Try first machine learning models (DS)
* 🎨 Explore deeper visual patterns & storytelling (DA)
