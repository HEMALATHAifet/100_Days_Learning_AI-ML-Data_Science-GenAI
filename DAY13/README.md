# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and VADER

---

## 📌 1. Task Name
**Sentiment Analysis of Text using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** from the NLTK library.

---

## 📚 2. What is NLTK?

**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** is a leading Python library used for **natural language processing (NLP)**. It provides tools for:
- Tokenization
- POS tagging
- Text classification
- Stemming/Lemmatization
- Sentiment analysis (like VADER)
- Working with corpora (like stopwords, WordNet)

---

## 📘 3. What is VADER?

**VADER** is a **rule-based sentiment analysis tool** included in NLTK. It uses a **predefined dictionary of words** with assigned sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral). It's specifically tuned for:
- Social media text
- Product reviews
- Short texts

---

## ✅ 4. Why Use VADER?

- ⚡ Fast and easy to use (no training needed)
- 🧠 Handles emojis, capitalization, punctuation, and slang
- 🔤 Works well on informal or real-world text
- 📊 Outputs both **sentiment score** and **label**

---

## ⚙️ 5. How VADER Works (with Example)

### 🔡 Sample Sentence:
```text
"I absolutely love this product! It's fantastic and worth every penny."
````

### 🧠 Logical Breakdown:

1. VADER tokenizes and analyzes each word.
2. Words like **"love"**, **"fantastic"**, **"worth"** are in its dictionary with positive scores.
3. It also considers **exclamation marks**, **adverbs ("absolutely")**, and **capitalization** to boost sentiment.
4. It returns a dictionary like:

```python
{
  'neg': 0.0,
  'neu': 0.337,
  'pos': 0.663,
  'compound': 0.875
}
```

* `compound` is the overall score ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
* You can classify:

  * `compound ≥ 0.05` → Positive
  * `compound ≤ -0.05` → Negative
  * Else → Neutral

---

## 🧾 6. Syntax Used

```python
# Import VADER
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize VADER
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze text
text = "I absolutely love this product!"
score = sia.polarity_scores(text)
print(score)

# Label it manually
def get_sentiment_label(score):
    if score['compound'] >= 0.05:
        return "Positive"
    elif score['compound'] <= -0.05:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

print(get_sentiment_label(score))
```

### 📌 Explanation:

* **Compound**: The overall sentiment score (-1 to +1)
* Adding intensifiers like **“absolutely”** or **exclamation marks (!)**\* boosts positive sentiment.
* Negative words like **“don’t”** flip the sentiment drastically.
* VADER accounts for:

  * **Punctuation** (!!! increases emotion)
  * **Capitalization** (LOVE vs love)
  * **Degree modifiers** (absolutely, very, kind of)
  * **Contrastive conjunctions** (“but”, “however”)
  * **Negations** (“not”, “don’t”)

## 🤔 9. Sentiment Analysis vs Emotion Detection

| Aspect         | Sentiment Analysis                         | Emotion Detection                                    |

| Purpose        | Classify text as positive/negative/neutral | Detect specific emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc.) |
| Output         | 3 classes (or a compound score)            | Multiple emotion labels (6+ emotions)                |
| Tools          | VADER, TextBlob, etc.                      | NRC Lexicon, BERT, transformers                      |
| Granularity    | Coarse                                     | Fine-grained                                         |
| Example Output | "Positive"                                 | "Joy, Surprise"                                      |
