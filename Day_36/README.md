## âœ… **Storytelling from Your Visuals**

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

To identify how key features like **BMI**, **Blood Sugar (BS)**, and **Systolic BP** vary across **Risk Levels** and what patterns help indicate **high-risk pregnancies**.

---

### ðŸ“Š 1. **BMI Distribution by Risk Level**

* You plotted **BMI** by `'Risk Level'` and added a red line at **BMI = 35**.
* âœ… **Insight:**
  From the boxplot, it's likely that:

  * Women classified as **High Risk** tend to have a **higher median BMI** than those in the Low Risk group.
  * A good number of **High Risk cases** fall **above the 35 BMI threshold**, which is considered **obese** and clinically significant.
  * The **spread** (IQR) may also be wider in the High group, indicating **greater variability**.

ðŸŸ¢ **Interpretation for Non-technical audience:**

> Pregnant women with a BMI above 35 are **much more likely to fall into the High-Risk category**, suggesting weight management could be important for prevention.

---

### ðŸ“Š 2. **Blood Sugar (BS) by Risk Level**

* You used a purple line to mark **BS = 140**.
* âœ… **Insight:**

  * The **High Risk group** shows more values above the 140 line.
  * The **median BS** might be closer to or above 140 for High Risk women, while **Low Risk** women tend to stay well below it.
  * This suggests a **strong correlation** between high blood sugar and pregnancy risk.

ðŸŸ¢ **Interpretation:**

> Elevated blood sugar levels are a **clear red flag** â€” women with BS over 140 are more likely to be classified as high-risk.

---

### ðŸ“Š 3. **Systolic BP by Risk Level**

* A green line at **140 Systolic BP** indicates a threshold for hypertension.
* âœ… **Insight:**

  * Like BMI and BS, **Systolic BP is higher in the High Risk group**.
  * You may see **outliers** or a longer upper whisker in the High group, pointing to **cases of severe hypertension**.
  * Low Risk cases generally stay under the 140 mark.

ðŸŸ¢ **Interpretation:**

> High systolic blood pressure (above 140) is **commonly associated with pregnancy risk**, aligning with medical guidelines on preeclampsia and hypertension.

---

## ðŸ§  Final Summary for Storytelling

> By visualizing BMI, Blood Sugar, and Systolic BP against Risk Level, we see a **consistent pattern**:
> **Higher values in these features are associated with High Risk pregnancies.**
> These insights are essential for **early screening**, **clinical awareness**, and building **predictive models**.
